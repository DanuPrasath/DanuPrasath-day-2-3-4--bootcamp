    <p>A laptop is a portable personal computer designed for easy transportation and use in various locations. It features a built-in monitor, keyboard, touchpad, and speakers, making it fully functional even without additional peripherals.
        Laptops are typically smaller and more expensive than desktop computers, and they are powered by batteries, allowing for mobile use.
        They come in various sizes, usually ranging from 10 inches to 20 inches in display size, and weigh up to a few pounds.
        The hardware specifications can vary significantly, but most laptops run on desktop operating systems and are suitable for tasks such as browsing the internet, creating documents, and playing games.
